// MVP

// Create a function called delayedIncDec(n, mode, delay) - this function needs to return a promise<number>,
// the value of the promise should be n after incrementing or decrementing depending on the mode

// if mode is anything other than inc or dec - reject the promise

// n - some number

// mode - string - "inc", "dec"

// inc will cause the function to increment n by 1

// dec will cause the function to decrement by 1

// timeout - delay in ms - your function will return a promise after that time

// timeout should have a default value, if the function is called without the 3rd argument, it should default to 2500

// call this function three times with different numbers and values of dec and delay
// console.log the value of rejected or resolved promise
