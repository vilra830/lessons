# Fetch challenge

1. Read the documentation of [cat facts API](https://catfact.ninja/#/Facts/getFacts)

2. Once you are familiar with how it works, create a small frontend application

- The application should have:
  - a from that asks the user for number of breeds (try and make it look good)
  - a heading that says 'Cat breeds'
  - an empty section for all the results
  - a p for errors

When the user submits the form you should make a GET request to `https://catfact.ninja/breeds?limit=${limit}`

Create a card element for each breed that will consist of:

- a div with a h3 that has the breed name
- a p with the country
- a p with coat info

Append all of the cards to the section for all the results
If an error gets thrown, display to the user
clear the form after each request
clear the results section before making a new one

split the code into modules
